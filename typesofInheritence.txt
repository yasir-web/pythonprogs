Types of Inheritence:
1. Single Inheritence
2. Hierarchical Inheritence
3. Multiple Inheritence
4. Multi-level Inheritence
5. Hybrid Inheritence

Single Inheritence: In this there is a single base class and single derived class
Syntax: classA:
    Varibles and Methods
classB(A):
    Varibles and Methods

Hierarchical Inheritence: In this there is a single base class and Multiple derivedc class
Syntax:
classA:
    Varibles and Methods
ClasB(A):
    Varibles and Methods
classC(A):
     Varibles and Methods
    
Multiple Inheritence: In This There are Multiple base class and single derived class
Syntax:
classA:
    Methods and Varibles
ClasB:
    Methods and Varibles
classC(A,B)
    Varibles and Methods

Multi-level Inheritence: In this
Syntax:
class A:
    Varibles and Methods
class B(A):
    Varibles and Methods
classC(C):
    Varibles and Methods

Hybrid Inheritence: If you use more than one Inheritence then resultant Inheritence is called Hybrid Inheritence
Syntax:
classA:
    Varibles and Methods
ClasB(A):
    Varibles and Methods
ClassB(A)
    Varibles and Methods
Class D:
    Varibles and Methods
Class C(B,D):
    Varibles and Methods
